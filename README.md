Developing of an integrated, technologically advanced system that improves the development and health of cinnamon plants for growers is the main goal of the project. With the goal of accurately estimating the age of cinnamon plants and accurately identifying leaf diseases in real time, this technology will provide customized cultivation guidance and actionable insights. The project aims to equip cinnamon growers with the required tools and expertise to assure sustainable and highquality tea production, optimize resource utilization, and perform timely interventions by utilizing modern machine learning and image processing techniques. The ultimate objective is to close the gap between current technical advancements and traditional cinnamon production techniques, promoting increased productivity and efficiency in tea farming.
